# **Approximation of Pi: A Simple and Accurate Estimation**  
**By 1nc0gn1t0**  

## **Abstract**  
Pi (\(\pi\)) is a fundamental mathematical constant that represents the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. Various approximations exist, such as \( \frac{22}{7} \) and \( \frac{355}{113} \), but these require fractions that are sometimes cumbersome to compute. This paper introduces a novel approximation:  

\[
\pi \approx \sqrt[3]{31}
\]

This method provides a simple yet highly accurate estimate of \(\pi\), with an error of only **0.00021**. The ease of calculation and remarkable precision make it a valuable tool for quick approximations in mathematical and scientific applications.

## **1. Introduction**  
The mathematical constant \(\pi\) is irrational and non-repeating, making it impossible to express exactly as a simple fraction. However, many approximations exist to facilitate calculations in practical scenarios.  

The most commonly used approximation, \( \frac{22}{7} \), has been widely accepted due to its simplicity, but it deviates from \(\pi\) by **0.00126**. A much more accurate alternative, \( \frac{355}{113} \), has a smaller error of **0.0000085**, but its large numerator and denominator make it less convenient for quick mental calculations.  

This paper introduces a **new, simple, and surprisingly precise approximation**:  

\[
\pi \approx \sqrt[3]{31}
\]  

This estimation is easy to compute and provides a closer value to \(\pi\) than the widely used \( \frac{22}{7} \).

## **2. Mathematical Derivation**  

### **2.1. Computing \(\sqrt[3]{31}\)**  
The cube root of 31 is:  

\[
\sqrt[3]{31} \approx 3.14138
\]

Comparing this with the actual value of \(\pi\):  

\[
\pi \approx 3.14159
\]

The absolute error in the approximation is:  

\[
|\pi - \sqrt[3]{31}| = |3.14159 - 3.14138| = 0.00021
\]

### **2.2. Comparison with Other Approximations**  
To demonstrate the accuracy of this new approximation, we compare it with other common values:  

| Approximation       | Value        | Absolute Error |  
|--------------------|-------------|---------------|  
| \( \frac{22}{7} \) | 3.142857 | 0.00126 |  
| \( \frac{355}{113} \) | 3.1415929 | 0.0000085 |  
| \( \sqrt[3]{31} \) | 3.14138 | 0.00021 |  

While \( \frac{355}{113} \) is still the most precise among these, \(\sqrt[3]{31}\) provides a much easier computation with almost the same accuracy.  

---

## **3. Practical Applications**  
This approximation can be useful in several scenarios:  

- **Quick estimations in geometry and trigonometry**  
- **Scientific calculations where high precision is not necessary**  
- **Educational purposes to introduce alternative ways of estimating \(\pi\)**  

Since cube roots are commonly available on scientific calculators, this method is both accessible and efficient.

## **4. Conclusion**  
The newly introduced **Sana’s Approximation of Pi**, given by **\(\sqrt[3]{31}\)**, provides a highly accurate and easy-to-compute estimate of \(\pi\). With an absolute error of only **0.00021**, it outperforms the traditional \( \frac{22}{7} \) approximation while remaining computationally simple. This method has the potential to be widely adopted in educational and practical settings as a quick yet precise way to approximate \(\pi\).
